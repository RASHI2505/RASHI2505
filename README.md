## Hey, viewer!👋

I'm Rashi Mishra, a final-year undergraduate. I’m pursuing  B.TECH (Major in Electronics and Communication Engineering | Minor in Computer Science Engineering) at BIT Mesra, Jharkhand. 
I developed my passion in Software Development, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Data Science and Frontend Development. Currently, I’m trying my hands on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Structure and algorithms.

My strengths include quick grasping power, decision making, creative thinking and punctuality. 
I’m well acquainted with programming languages like C, C++, and Python(Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib) along with Computer fundamentals like DBMS, OOPs, Operating Systems and Computer Networks.
